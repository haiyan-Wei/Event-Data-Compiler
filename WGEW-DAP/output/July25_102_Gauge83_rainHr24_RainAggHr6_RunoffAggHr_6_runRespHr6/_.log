Description: This is a log file created with the following script. Please turn off the option of "wrap text" to view.

Script location: /WGEW-DAP/DEC_DAP_Lucky_Hills_example_inputs.py
Objectives:
        1. Query runoff, rainfall, soil moisture, and sediment data from the DAP data server
        2. Create .pre files
        3. Plot hyetograph and hydrographs
        4. Create a summary table for all events

Definitions:
        1. record: a measured rainfall (or runoff) value with a timestamp
        2. segment: a set of rainfall (or runoff) records between two zero records
        3. runoff-rainfall event: a series of rainfall and runoff records (or segments) that are appropriately aligned so that the selected runoff records form an independent runoff event that is responsive to the chosen rainfall records
